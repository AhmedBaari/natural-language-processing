It was July 2019 when I, a child, was about to watch the livestream of an Indian rocket launch for the first time in my life. My grandma was serving lunch quickly as I was getting desperate to not miss the launch. Little did I know what this rocket launch was for and what ISRO was actually planning to do! It was Chandrayaan-2, India's prestigious moon mission to map and study the variations in lunar surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water.

Wait… lunar water?

The Chandrayaan Series
Chandrayaan 1, 2 and 3 are the names of India's lunar exploration missions, which means "moon vehicle" in Sanskrit. Each mission had different objectives and achievements, but they all shared the common goal of advancing India's scientific and technological capabilities in space.


Chandrayaan-1
Chandrayaan-1 was India's first mission to the moon, launched in 2008. It consisted of an orbiter that circled the moon for 10 months and mapped its surface, especially the polar regions. It also deployed an impactor that crashed into the moon near the south pole and searched for water ice. Chandrayaan-1 made several important discoveries, such as the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface and the existence of a thin atmosphere around the moon, thus we can consider this mission a partial success.

Chandrayaan-2
Chandrayaan-2 was India's second mission to the moon, launched in 2019 (this is the mission who's rocket launch I watched for the first time). The main objective of Chandrayaan-2 was to land on or near the lunar south pole, a region that has not been explored by any previous mission, and study its topography, mineralogy, and water ice distribution. The orbiter successfully reached the lunar orbit and conducted remote sensing observations of the moon. But the lander and the rover suddenly lost contact with ISRO during the final descent and crashed on the lunar surface. That was really sad, considering the years of hardwork ISRO put into all this. Despite the setback, Chandrayaan-2 was considered a partial success too, as it achieved most of its objectives and demonstrated India's technological capabilities in space exploration.

But, there's a saying…

"Success is not about how many times you succeed. It's about how many times you learn from failures and setbacks." - APJ Abdul Kalam

and ISRO did just that! The result is Chandrayaan-3.

Chandrayaan-3
Chandrayaan Lander On Moon

Chandrayaan-3 is a repeat attempt of Chandrayaan-2, with some improvements and modifications. It consists of a lander and a rover that landed on the south pole of the moon today (23 August) to conduct scientific experiments. It also has an orbiter that provides communication and navigation support to the lander and rover. The main objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are

To demonstrate a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface ( Done)
To demonstrate rover operations on the moon ( Up Next)
To conduct in-situ scientific experiments on the lunar surface
The statement that astonished me when I had seen it:

Chandrayaan-1 made several important discoveries, such as the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface

Let's talk about it.

Water On The Moon?
Water on Moon by MIT

People have been curious about this for a long time, so nations all around the world sent spacecrafts to fly to the moon and explore it.

Some of these spacecrafts stayed in space and looked at the moon from far away.
Some of these landed on the moon and took pictures and samples of the rocks and soil.
Some of them literally crashed into the moon on purpose and made a big dust cloud!!!
Chandrayaan-1 used two tools from The US to find water on the moon.

One of them was a camera that could see different colours of light that we cannot see. This camera could tell if there was water or something else on the moon by looking at how the light bounced off the surface.
The other tool was a radar that could send signals to the moon and listen to how they came back. This radar could tell if there was ice or something else on the moon by looking at how the signals changed.

Chandrayaan-1 used these tools to look at many places on the moon, especially near the top and bottom where it is very cold and dark. It found out that there was some ice in these places! It also found out that there were some water drops on other places and there were some water atoms inside the rocks and dust.

But the fact is, India wasn't the first country to find water on the moon. In fact, there's an entire space race involved in contributing information about water on the moon.

Other Countries Were Involved In Finding Water On The Moon Too!
The Soviet Union was the first country to find water on the moon in 1976, when its Luna 24 probe returned lunar soil samples containing 0.1% water by mass.
The United States confirmed the presence of water molecules on the sunlit surface of the moon in 2020, using its SOFIA observatory.
China was the first country to detect water on the moon at its landing site in real time in 2020, when its "Chang'e 5" probe returned lunar rock samples containing traces of water.
So what's next?

ISRO's Future Plans
ISRO WallpaperISRO has many ambitious and exciting missions lined up for the next decade. And one of them is absolutely exciting…

INDIA IS GOING TO VENUS!
Shukrayaan, meaning "Venus Vehicle" in Sanskrit, is expected to launch in December 2024 using a GSLV Mk II rocket from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh. It will take about six months to reach Venus and enter an elliptical orbit around it. The orbit will have a closest point of about 500 km.

Other Missions
Aditya L1 Mission: This mission will study the sun and how it affects the vehicles in space. The objective of this mission is to find a stable point between the sun and the earth and stay in balance between the two.
Gaganyaan Mission: This mission will demonstrate ISRO's capability for human spaceflight to low earth orbit and safe return to the earth. With its manned space mission in 2023, India aims to become the fourth nation to send humans to space after US, Russia and China.
Mangalyaan 2 Mission: This mission will follow up on the success of Mangalyaan 1, India's first mission to Mars, launched in 2013. The objective of this mission is to further explore the red planet and its moons, Phobos and Deimos.
ISRO's upcoming goals show how they want to boost India's science and tech skills in space exploration, all to help people through useful applications. India today is marked as the world's most efficient space player.

What A Nationwide Success!

As I watched the live broadcast of Chandrayaan-3, I could feel the tension and excitement in the air. The ISRO scientists and engineers were monitoring the spacecraft's status and communicating with each other. The lander had separated from the orbiter and initiated the powered descent phase. The lander had to perform a series of complex manoeuvres to reduce its speed and altitude, while avoiding any obstacles on the surface.

The final moments were nerve-wracking. The lander had to fire its thrusters at the right time and angle to achieve a soft and safe landing. The ISRO team had to wait for a few seconds for the signals to reach Earth, due to the distance between the moon and Earth. Those few seconds felt like eternity.

Then, it happened. The lander successfully landed on the surface of the lunar south pole. The ISRO team erupted in cheers and applause. They had done it! They had achieved India's first soft landing on the moon!

How beautiful
